# Scheduling Algorithm  

This project involves implementing several different process scheduling algo rithms. The scheduler will be assigned a predefined set of tasks and will schedule the tasks based on the selected scheduling algorithm. Each task is assigned a priority and CPU burst. The following scheduling algorithms will be implemented:  

- First-come,first-served(FCFS), which schedulestasksintheorderinwhich they request the CPU.
- Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the tasksâ€™ next CPU burst.
- Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority.
- Round-robin (RR) scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum (or for the remainder of its CPU burst).
- Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.

Priorities range from 1 to 10, where a higher numeric value indicates a higher relative priority. For round-robin scheduling, the length of a time quantum is 10 milliseconds.  


## I. Implementation  

The implementation of this project may be completed in either C or Java, and program files supporting both of these languages are provided in the source codedownloadforthetext.Thesesupportingfilesreadinthescheduleoftasks, insert the tasks into a list, and invoke the scheduler.  

The schedule of tasks has the form ***[task name] [priority] [CPU burst]***, with the following example format:  

```
T1, 4, 20
T2, 2, 25
T3, 3, 25
T4, 3, 15
T5, 10, 10
```

Thus, task T1 has priority 4 and a CPU burst of 20 milliseconds, and so forth. It is assumed that all tasks arrive at the same time, so your scheduler algorithms do not have to support higher-priority processes preempting processes with lower priorities. In addition, tasks do not have to be placed into a queue or list in any particular order.  

There are a few different strategies for organizing the list of tasks, as f irst presented in Section 5.1.2. One approach is to place all tasks in a single unorderedlist, where the strategyfor task selectiondependson the scheduling algorithm. For example, SJF scheduling would search the list to find the task with the shortest next CPU burst. Alternatively, a list could be ordered accord ing to scheduling criteria (that is, by priority). One other strategy involves havingaseparatequeueforeachuniquepriority,asshown inFigure5.7.These approaches are briefly discussed in Section 5.3.6. It is also worth highlight ing that we are using the terms list and queue somewhat interchangeably. However, a queue has very specific FIFO functionality, whereas a list does not have such strict insertion and deletion requirements. You are likely to find the functionality of a general list to be more suitable when completing this project.  


## II. C Implementation Details  

The file `driver.c` reads in the schedule of tasks, inserts each task into a linked list, and invokes the process scheduler by calling the `schedule()` function. The `schedule()` function executes each task according to the specified scheduling algorithm. Tasks selected for execution on the CPU are determined by the pick `NextTask()` function and are executed by invoking the `run()` function defined in the `CPU.c` file. A Makefile is used to determine the specific scheduling algorithm that will be invoked by driver. For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, we would enter  

<pre><code>make fcfs</code></pre>  

and would execute the scheduler (using the schedule of tasks `schedule.txt`) as follows:  

<pre><code>./fcfs schedule.txt</code></pre>  

Refer to the `README` file in the source code download for further details. Before proceeding, be sure to familiarize yourself with the source code provided as well as the `Makefile`.  


### Java Implementation Details  

The file `Driver.java` reads in the schedule of tasks, inserts each task into a Java `ArrayList`, and invokes the process scheduler by calling the `schedule()` method. The following interface identifies a generic scheduling algorithm, which the five different scheduling algorithms will implement:  

```
public interface Algorithm
{
  // Implementation of scheduling algorithm
   public void schedule();
   // Selects the next task to be scheduled
   public Task pickNetTask();
}
```
The `schedule()` method obtains the next task to be run on the CPU by invoking the `pickNextTask()` method and then executes this `Task` by calling the `static run()` method in the `CPU.java` class.  

The program is run as follows:  

<pre><code>java Driver fcfs schedule.txt</code></pre>  

Refer to the `README` file in the source code download for further details. Before proceeding, be sure to familiarize yourself with all Java source files provided in the source code download.  


## IV. Further Challenges  

Two additional challenges are presented for this project:  

1. Each task provided to the scheduler is assigned a unique task (tid). If a scheduler is running in an SMP environment where each CPU is separately running its own scheduler, there is a possible race condition on the variable that is used to assign task identifiers. Fix this race condition using an atomic integer.
   On Linux and macOS systems, the `__sync_fetch_and_add()` function can be used to atomically increment an integer value. As an example, the following code sample atomically increments value by 1:
   ```
   int value = 0;
   __sync_fetch_and_add(&value,1);
   ```
   Refer to the Java API for details on how to use the `AtomicInteger` class for Java programs.

2. Calculate the average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for each of the scheduling algorithms.
